This is a file to compile Python codes for 101 level courses.
Its currently designed to work with the UBLearns file submission system.
If wished to use with the timberlake submissions, simply omit the createFolders() function.

Main notes to make:
1) runs on python 2.7 (reason being is usually 101 utilizes Python 2.7)
2) Make sure to change the directory paths set.  Currently set to the author's directory path.
3) changing the function imports from solution
